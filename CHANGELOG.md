# Project Changelog - UBC Tech Prep Portfolio

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application built with React.js frontend and Flask backend, featuring a blog-style post system with comments, code editor integration, and user management.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Monaco Editor, React Router DOM
- **Backend**: Flask, SQLAlchemy, Flask-Migrate
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens, Werkzeug password hashing

## Development History

### API Configuration Refactoring (October 12, 2025)

**Centralized API Endpoint Management:**

- Refactored all hardcoded API URLs across the frontend to use centralized `API_ENDPOINTS` configuration
- Updated the following components to import and use `API_ENDPOINTS` from `config/api.js`:
  - `App.js` - All posts, comments, courses, and user endpoints
  - `AuthContext.js` - Authentication profile endpoints
  - `LoginModal.js` - Login endpoint
  - `SignUpModal.js` - Registration endpoint
  - `AddPost.js` - Course creation endpoint
- Implemented consistent use of `getAuthHeaders()` helper function for authenticated requests
- Improved code maintainability, readability, and safety by eliminating URL duplication
- Enhanced environment configuration flexibility - API base URL can now be changed via `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable
- All API endpoints are now managed in a single location (`frontend/src/config/api.js`), making it easy to update URLs for different environments (development, staging, production)

**Benefits:**

- Single source of truth for API endpoints
- Type-safe endpoint construction with function-based dynamic URLs (e.g., `API_ENDPOINTS.POSTS.DELETE(id)`)
- Consistent authorization header management
- Easier testing and debugging
- Reduced risk of typos and inconsistencies

### UI Layout Update (October 12, 2025)

**Frontend Button Layout:**

- Modified button layout in App.js to display the three main navigation buttons (Add Post, My Posts, Courses) in a horizontal row instead of a vertical column
- Consolidated three separate `.button-bar` divs into a single container for better layout control
- Improved visual hierarchy and user experience with more compact navigation

### Security & Maintainability Overhaul (October 5, 2025) ‚≠ê MAJOR UPDATE

This update implements comprehensive best practices for production-ready security and maintainability.

#### üîê Security Enhancements

**Environment Variable Management:**

- Implemented `python-dotenv` for secure environment variable handling
- Created `.env.example` template with all configuration options
- Moved sensitive data (SECRET_KEY, JWT_SECRET_KEY, DB_PASSWORD) to environment variables
- Added validation warnings for default/insecure keys on startup
- Updated docker-compose.yml to use environment variables with secure defaults

**Input Validation & Sanitization:**

- Created comprehensive validation utilities (`backend/utils/validation.py`):
  - `validate_password()` - Enforces strong password requirements
  - `validate_email()` - Email format and length validation
  - `validate_username()` - Username format validation
  - `validate_course_code()` - Course code format validation
  - `validate_string_length()` - Generic length validation with custom limits
- Created sanitization utilities (`backend/utils/sanitization.py`):
  - `sanitize_html()` - Prevents XSS attacks while allowing safe HTML
  - `sanitize_plain_text()` - Strips all HTML for plain text fields
  - `sanitize_code()` - Escapes code snippets for safe display
  - Configurable allowed HTML tags, attributes, and protocols
- Applied sanitization to all user inputs:
  - Usernames, emails (plain text)
  - Post titles, course codes (plain text)
  - Post content, comments (sanitized HTML)
  - Code snippets (escaped)

**Rate Limiting:**

- Integrated `Flask-Limiter` for API rate limiting
- Configured per-endpoint rate limits:
  - Registration: 5 attempts per hour
  - Login: 10 attempts per minute
  - Password change: 3 attempts per hour
  - General API: 100 requests per hour (configurable)
- Rate limits applied per IP address
- Custom error handler for 429 (Too Many Requests)
- Configurable via `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` and `RATE_LIMIT_DEFAULT` env vars

**Security Headers:**

- Created security middleware (`backend/middlewares/security.py`)
- Added comprehensive security headers to all responses:
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking
  - `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - Browser XSS protection
  - `Content-Security-Policy` - Restricts resource loading
  - `Strict-Transport-Security` - Ready for HTTPS (commented, enable in production)

**CORS Configuration:**

- Restricted CORS to specific origins only
- Configurable via `CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable
- No more wildcard (*) origins - production-ready
- Credentials support with `supports_credentials=True`

**Authentication Improvements:**

- Updated JWT token generation to use configurable expiration
- Token verification moved to use centralized config
- Added type hints for better code safety
- Improved error messages for authentication failures

#### üìä Logging & Monitoring

**Comprehensive Logging System:**

- Created logging utilities (`backend/utils/logger.py`):
  - `setup_logger()` - Configurable logger with file and console handlers
  - `log_security_event()` - Dedicated security event logging
  - `get_request_info()` - Extract request metadata (IP, path, user agent)
  - `log_api_call()` - Decorator for API call logging
- Configurable log level and file location via environment variables
- Structured log format with timestamp, level, and message
- Security event tracking:
  - Failed login attempts
  - Invalid token usage
  - Rate limit violations
  - Password change attempts
  - Registration duplicates

**What Gets Logged:**

- User registrations (username, user ID)
- Successful logins (username, user ID)
- Failed login attempts (username, IP)
