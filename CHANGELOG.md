## Known Issues & Technical Debt

- ~~No user authentication (intentionally simplified)~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- ~~No password protection for user accounts~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- ~~Limited user profile functionality~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- ~~No dynamic course management~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- No search or filtering capabilities
- No post categories or tags management
- No password reset functionality
- No email verification system

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

- ~~User authentication with proper security~~ ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**
- ~~User profiles and avatars~~ ‚úÖ **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**
- ~~Dynamic course management~~ ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**
- Password reset and email verification
- Post search and filtering
- Post categories and tags
- Rich text editing for post content
- File upload capabilities
- Real-time notifications
- User roles and permissions
- OAuth integration (Google, GitHub)
- Two-factor authentication

## Development Notes

- Use `npm start` in frontend/ to run React dev server
- Use `docker compose up` for backend and database
- Database migrations: `flask db migrate` and `flask db upgrade`
- **NEW**: Authentication requires valid JWT tokens in Authorization headers
- **NEW**: Protected routes automatically redirect unauthenticated users
- **NEW**: User registration includes password strength validation
- **NEW**: Courses are managed dynamically through API endpoints

## Authentication System Usage

### Backend

- JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
- Password requirements: 8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number
- All protected routes require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- User sessions persist across browser restarts via localStorage

### Frontend

- Login/Register modals accessible from header
- Authentication state managed globally via React Context
- Protected UI elements only visible to authenticated users
- Automatic token inclusion in API requests

## Course Management System Usage

### Backend

- Courses are stored in separate `courses` table
- Course codes are automatically converted to uppercase
- Duplicate course codes are prevented
- Course deletion requires authentication and ownership

### Frontend

- Courses are fetched dynamically from API
- Users can add new courses when creating posts
- Course selection shows both code and name
- Courses display in popup modal with grid layout

## Last Updated

- Date: September 6, 2025
- Status: **MAJOR UPDATE** - Dynamic course management and user posts system implemented
- Next Priority: Search functionality, post filtering, or advanced features
- Authentication Status: **PRODUCTION READY** ‚úÖ
- Course Management Status: **PRODUCTION READY** ‚úÖ

## Repository Structure Changes

- **Frontend Integration**: Moved frontend folder from separate GitHub repository to main repository
- **Monorepo Structure**: Now using single repository for full-stack application
- **Git Submodule Removal**: Eliminated submodule complexity for simpler development workflow
- **Unified Version Control**: All frontend and backend changes now tracked in single repository
